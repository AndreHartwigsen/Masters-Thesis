# Masters-Thesis
Code used for my masters thesis


This  is much of the code used for my masters thesis
Beware that much of the code is not commented, and many functions are resused for multiple different things
Many parts are just commented out, this was not originally intended to be seen, but i don't mind putting it here
Beware that most codes use files from COSMOS2020 not included on GitHub (I cannot upload 150gB worth of data)


FilterCurves is the code generating the filter curves
GalSpec is the code for fitting the NOT spectrum
Planck integration is for the simulated Color-color histogram in the appendix

MainCodes are the codes for histogram selection, lensed objects selection and the main SEDs for the selected LBG's

-Good luck :)
